You're always trying to grow upward, you're supposed to act of the highest good, your capable of being as an antidote of the limitations of that mountain, it's a long journey to specify the place on the highest pinnacle, that's symbolic because, of course, it's a pinnacle, just as your always trying to reach it, you're always trying to shoot for it. Youree always trying to climb upward, at least that's the theory, of course, that depends on your definition of upward. <br><br> Youree supposed to again, act out the highest good of which you are capable, now that will transform your life to some degree, into an archetypal adventure. There's no way around that because as you attempt to climb your highest mountain, let's say, to aim at a higher target or something like that, the things around you will become increasingly dramatic and of importance. <br><br> That happens by necessity. Obviously, if you're aiming at something difficult and profound, and you're really working at it, then your life is going to become increasingly difficult and profound, that might be okay, that might be exactly what you need. As an antidote to the implicit limitations that face you as a human being. "
