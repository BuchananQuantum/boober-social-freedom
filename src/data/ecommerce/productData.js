    desc: `<p>Over the years, Apple has built a reputation for releasing its products with a lot of fanfare ‚Äì but that didn‚Äôt exactly happen for the MacBook Pro 2018.

And, as with previous generations the 15-inch MacBook Pro arrives alongside a 13-inch model.</p>
          <p>Apple still loves the MacBook Pro though, despite the quiet release.
